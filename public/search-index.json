    "content": "High School Applicants {/* Sidebar Navigation */} {/* Main Content */} Application and Essays If you would like to apply to become a Lu Scholar, please do so online by submitting the{' '} Lu Scholar Application . When you apply to the Lu Memorial Scholarship, you are applying with other high school and undergraduate students, so it's okay if you do not have any future ideas yet. We encourage you to indicate prospective majors and career interests in the application, but please know you are not bound by these selections in any way. The Lu Scholar Application includes essay prompts for your personal essay. You may notice below that they look similar to{' '} Common Application's essay prompts . In addition to the personal essay, we also require the Lu Scholar Questions, which you can access and submit through the Lu Scholar Application once you complete the personal essay. The essays are your chance to tell us about yourself in your own words; there are no right or wrong answers and you should allow your genuine voice to come through. These questions help us get to know you as a friend, a future scientist, and a person who may make a distinctive contribution to the world. Personal Essay (500 words) Choose ONE of the following prompts: Some aspects of our identity or background are so fundamental to who we are that our story feels incomplete without them. Reflect on an element of your identity, experience, or talent that has significantly shaped your values and aspirations. How has this influenced your perspective and goals? Describe a time when you faced a significant obstacle, setback, or failure. How did you respond to this adversity? What specific lessons emerged from this experience, and how have these insights influenced your approach to subsequent challenges? Discuss a topic, idea, or concept that captivates you so completely you lose track of time when exploring it. What sparked this passion? How do you pursue this interest, and what does your engagement with this subject reveal about who you are and how you think? Identify a pressing challenge in your community or the world that you feel called to address. What personal experiences connect you to this issue? Share your innovative approach to making a meaningful difference, including specific steps you've taken or would implement. Share an essay on any subject that illuminates an important aspect of yourself not covered elsewhere in your application. This may be a previously written piece or an entirely new composition. Lu Scholar Questions (200 words for each, all required) If you could host a dinner party and invite any three people (living, historical, or fictional), who would you choose and what would you cook? What conversation topic would you introduce to spark the most interesting discussion between your guests? It's 2040, and a newspaper has just published a story about your impact on the world. Write the headline and first paragraph of this article. What did you accomplish, and why does it matter? Describe a book, film, song, or work of art that impacted you in a way its creator never intended. How did you discover meaning that others might have missed, and how has this alternative interpretation shaped an important aspect of your life? Identify an unspoken social convention or unwritten rule that you believe deserves to be questioned. Why does this invisible boundary exist, and what would be gained if more people were willing to examine or challenge it? What personal experience led you to notice this unwritten rule?

    "content": "High School Applicants {/* Sidebar Navigation */} {/* Main Content */} Transcript and Required School Forms We require an official high school transcript, a school report form and recommendation from your counselor, and a letter of recommendation from at least one teacher (up to two). Transcript An official transcript (grades 9–12) is required for all students. For students pursuing an international curriculum (e.g., A-Level, national curriculum, or IB Diploma outside the US), academic results and predictions are required if available. All official transcripts and results must be sent directly from a school official. We will not accept transcripts from applicants. Official transcripts are required for high school, college, university, or online courses not reported on your current high school transcript. A midyear transcript is due within two weeks after the application deadline. A final transcript, with the graduation date , is due by July 1 if you are selected as a Lu Scholar. A high school diploma or the equivalent is required for the Lu Memorial Scholarship. School Report Form and Counselor Recommendation These documents must be submitted by your high school college counselor or another school administrator. In the Lu Scholar Application , students invite a counselor to complete the School Report form and Counselor Recommendation form, which includes a recommendation letter. Note : the School Report form is a required form located in the application and submitted by your counselor. The School Report form tells us about your academic strengths in the context of the academic programs available in your school. Your high school may have a published school profile, but this profile on its own does not fulfill the School Report form requirement. Letters of Recommendation A letter of recommendation from at least one teacher is required (up to two permitted). We recommend requesting letters from grade 11 or 12 teachers in English, math, science, world language, or history/social studies. You may request a letter from a grade 10 teacher if the coursework was advanced (e.g., Honors, AP, IB). Letters from classroom teachers are strongly preferred. If there is another person who knows you well and can provide new insights about you, you may have one additional recommender submit a letter on your behalf. Please assign this person as your \"Other Recommender\" in the Lu Scholar Application. This is the fastest method for a letter to reach your file. How to Submit Required Materials We request that school personnel use the Lu Scholar Application online forms whenever possible to submit documents. This is the fastest method for materials to reach your file. If online submission is not possible, school personnel may send materials as an email attachment to scholarship@lu-memorial.org . Ask your school to include your full legal name, school, and date of birth on all correspondence with the scholarship office. When ordering college transcripts, please use scholarship@lu-memorial.org as the contact email. As a standard practice, we offer a grace period after the application deadline during which teachers and counselors may submit application materials. Materials submitted by others may take several weeks to process. If your checklist is not complete by the deadline, simply continue to check your Lu Scholar portal until we have received all items. Visit our After Submitting Your Application page for more information. Updated on March 28, 2025"

    "content": "High School Applicants {/* Sidebar Navigation */} {/* Main Content */} Guidelines for Homeschooled Applicants Homeschooled students, like all other students seeking the Lu Memorial Scholarship, apply using the Lu Scholar Application. These additional guidelines may be helpful as you complete your application. Academic Record We expect that you have successfully undertaken a rigorous course of study distributed across the humanities, sciences, math, social studies and languages. In addition to a transcript, we encourage you to submit a detailed description of your curriculum, but it is not necessary to follow a prescribed or approved homeschooling program. We are interested in how you have gone about the learning process, not how many courses you have completed. In particular, we would like to understand: how and why your family chose homeschooling how your learning process was organized what benefits accrued what, if any, choices you had to make to accomplish this type of education Optional Supplementary Testing We welcome SAT Subject Test, AP and/or IB exam scores from homeschooled students as an additional measure of academic preparation, though these are not required. Letters of Recommendation We require two letters of recommendation: one from a teacher or instructor of the student's choice and one from a parent or guardian who has served as the primary educator. While a parent may write one of the letters, we prefer that at least one recommendation letter comes from an external instructor who has taught the student in an academic setting. For example, a community college professor, online course instructor, or local educational cooperative teacher. Additional Materials Homeschooled applicants are welcome to submit additional materials that demonstrate their academic preparation, intellectual curiosity, and commitment to positive change. This might include: Examples of significant research projects Documentation of community service or leadership Evidence of participation in academic competitions Samples of creative work (though these are not required) The Lu Memorial Scholarship values innovative approaches to education, and we recognize that homeschooling often fosters unique skills and perspectives. We encourage you to highlight the distinctive aspects of your educational journey in your application. Updated on March 28, 2025"

This information will be updated. International Applicants Undocumented Applicants {/* Main Content */} Holistic Selection At the Lu Memorial Scholarship Foundation, we practice holistic selection. This means that each piece in your application is reviewed as part of an integrated and comprehensive whole. One piece tells us about your background and life experiences, another about your school and your academic achievement. We learn from others about your character and intellectual contributions. In your essays, we learn about your ideas and interests, and what is meaningful to you. Each year, we aim to select a diverse group of scholars with varied backgrounds and experiences, talents, academic interests, and ways of viewing the world. In a holistic review, we seek to understand how you, as a whole person, would grow, contribute, and make a positive impact with the support of our scholarship, and how you embody the values that Tingyu Lu represented. Context Just as no two Lu Scholars are the same, each applicant is unique. This means that as we review your application, we pay careful attention to your unique circumstances. We take into account your background, educational pathway, and work and family responsibilities. By focusing on your achievements in context, we evaluate how you have excelled in your environment and how you have taken advantage of opportunities available to you in your school and community. Academic Excellence A primary criterion for the Lu Memorial Scholarship is academic excellence. We look for your preparation and potential to succeed. We expect you to challenge yourself throughout your educational journey and to do very well by maintaining a strong academic record. The most important credential for evaluating your academic record is your transcript. Please know that our evaluation goes beyond any numerical formula. There is no minimum GPA or test score requirement to be considered for the scholarship. We evaluate each application in its entirety and in context. Innovative Thinking We want to see your commitment, dedication, and genuine interest in expanding your intellectual horizons, both in what you write about yourself and in what others write on your behalf. We look for evidence of creative problem-solving, original approaches to challenges, and the ability to think beyond conventional boundaries. Innovative thinking was a core value of Tingyu Lu, and we seek scholars who demonstrate this quality in various aspects of their lives. Commitment to Positive Change Learning about your engagement with your community and dedication to making a positive impact helps us understand your potential as a Lu Scholar. We are interested in how you have worked to address challenges and create positive change, whether in your school, community, or broader society. Students often assume our primary concern is the number of activities in which an applicant participates. In fact, an exceptional depth of experience in one or two initiatives may demonstrate your commitment more than minimal participation in many different activities. You may also have work or family responsibilities. These are as important as any other activities. In general, we want to understand the impact you have had in your job, in your family, in a club, in your school, or in the larger community, and we want to learn of the impact that experience has had on you. It is important to know these elements are not listed in order of importance in our evaluation and selection process. We review applications holistically. No portion of the application is considered without the rest of the application. Updated on March 28, 2025"

When you apply to the Lu Memorial Scholarship, you are applying with other high school and undergraduate students, so it's okay if you do not have any future ideas yet. We encourage you to indicate prospective majors and career interests in the application, but please know you are not bound by these selections in any way. The Lu Scholar Application includes essay prompts for your personal essay. You may notice below that they look similar to{' '} Common Application's essay prompts . In addition to the personal essay, we also require the Lu Scholar Questions, which you can access and submit through the Lu Scholar Application once you complete the personal essay. The essays are your chance to tell us about yourself in your own words; there are no right or wrong answers and you should allow your genuine voice to come through. These questions help us get to know you as a friend, a future scientist, and a person who may make a distinctive contribution to the world. Personal Essay (500 words) Choose ONE of the following prompts: Some aspects of our identity or background are so fundamental to who we are that our story feels incomplete without them. Reflect on an element of your identity, experience, or talent that has significantly shaped your values and aspirations. How has this influenced your perspective and goals? Describe a time when you faced a significant obstacle, setback, or failure. How did you respond to this adversity? What specific lessons emerged from this experience, and how have these insights influenced your approach to subsequent challenges? Discuss a topic, idea, or concept that captivates you so completely you lose track of time when exploring it. What sparked this passion? How do you pursue this interest, and what does your engagement with this subject reveal about who you are and how you think? Identify a pressing challenge in your community or the world that you feel called to address. What personal experiences connect you to this issue? Share your innovative approach to making a meaningful difference, including specific steps you've taken or would implement. Share an essay on any subject that illuminates an important aspect of yourself not covered elsewhere in your application. This may be a previously written piece or an entirely new composition. Lu Scholar Questions (200 words for each, all required) If you could host a dinner party and invite any three people (living, historical, or fictional), who would you choose and what would you cook? What conversation topic would you introduce to spark the most interesting discussion between your guests? It's 2040, and a newspaper has just published a story about your impact on the world. Write the headline and first paragraph of this article. What did you accomplish, and why does it matter? Describe a book, film, song, or work of art that impacted you in a way its creator never intended. How did you discover meaning that others might have missed, and how has this alternative interpretation shaped an important aspect of your life? Identify an unspoken social convention or unwritten rule that you believe deserves to be questioned. Why does this invisible boundary exist, and what would be gained if more people were willing to examine or challenge it? What personal experience led you to notice this unwritten rule?

    "content": "Undergraduate Applicants {/* Sidebar Navigation */} {/* Main Content */} Transcript and Required School Forms An official high school transcript (or equivalent, such as a GED), official transcript(s) from every college/university attended, and a college report are required. Transcripts Ask your high school to submit your official high school transcript (including your graduation date). If you attended an international high school and you have leaving exams (such as A-Levels or IB results), you are required to submit these scores. If there are challenges to obtaining your high school transcript, you may send a copy of your high school diploma, a document that indicates you have graduated from high school, or a copy of your leaving exams. Request official transcripts from every college/university attended. A midyear transcript / mid-term report is not required for undergraduate applicants. College Report In a college report, your academic dean, advisor, or other school administrator enters your college GPA and information regarding your academic standing at the institution. This information is essential for the review of your application. Ask an official at your current institution to fill out a college report form. The College Report form is available in the Lu Scholar Application portal. Your academic advisor will receive access to this form when you list them as a recommender in your application. Letters of Recommendation A letter of recommendation from at least one teacher or professor is required (up to two permitted). For undergraduate applicants, we recommend requesting letters from professors in your field of study or in courses relevant to your academic interests. If there is another person who knows you well and can provide new insights about you, you may have one additional recommender submit a letter on your behalf. Please assign this person as your \"Other Recommender\" in the Lu Scholar Application. This is the fastest method for a letter to reach your file. How to Submit Required Materials High school and college officials may submit application materials online through the application or by email attachment to scholarship@lu-memorial.org . When ordering college transcripts, please use scholarship@lu-memorial.org as the contact email. Give school personnel ample time to complete and send the forms prior to the application deadline. It is your responsibility to ensure that we receive official copies of all required documents. Materials submitted by others may take several days to process. If your checklist is not complete by the deadline, please simply check your Lu Scholar portal regularly until we have processed all items.

The second letter can come from another professor, academic advisor, research mentor, or other individual who can speak to your academic abilities and potential. If you have been out of college for several years and have been active in the workforce, you may substitute one work reference in place of one academic recommendation. Similarly, if you have significant research or internship experience, you may submit a letter from your research advisor or internship supervisor. Recommender Guidelines Strong letters of recommendation provide specific examples that demonstrate your academic excellence, innovative thinking, and commitment to positive change. We encourage you to select recommenders who can speak to these qualities and provide meaningful insights about your academic achievements and personal character. Please give your recommenders sufficient time to write their letters. It's considerate to provide them with at least 2-3 weeks notice before the application deadline.

    "content": "{/* Header Banner */} ALUMNI VOLUNTEERS Alumni volunteers share their experiences and serve as resources for prospective students who want to learn more about the Lu Memorial Scholarship opportunity. ← Back to Alumni Volunteers Eligibility Requirements You are eligible to be an alumni volunteer if you are a previous Lu Scholar or family member of a current Lu Scholar. An understanding of or willingness to learn about the Lu Memorial Scholarship program and its values is required to engage in volunteer activities. You are not eligible to participate as an alumni volunteer if you: Have a family member (child, sibling, etc.) who is applying to the Lu Memorial Scholarship in the current cycle. Each year, a number of volunteers ask if they may remain active while they have a family member who is applying. We ask alumni who have family members applying to mark themselves as inactive for the year that the student is applying. Please contact the Lu Memorial Scholarship Foundation via email at scholarship@lu-memorial.org if you have questions about your personal circumstances. Are a scholarship or college admission professional (including a high school guidance counselor or independent consultant). Interview for any other scholarship organization with a similar mission. Are engaged in volunteer or professional activities that may create a conflict of interest. The only approved activity related to other scholarship programs is writing recommendation letters. Should you write one for a Lu Memorial Scholarship applicant, please note that you are an alumni interviewer. Are a current Lu Memorial Scholarship Foundation employee or board member. These requirements are designed to avoid any appearance of a conflict of interest. By removing any suggestion of improper influence, we are able to create a comfortable environment for both applicants and volunteers, as well as to safeguard the best interests of the Foundation and its candidates for selection. Volunteers are asked to review and update their eligibility status annually to reflect their circumstances. Eligibility requirements extend to all volunteer activities, not just the interview program. Service as an alumni volunteer is a privilege and not a right. A volunteer may elect to end participation at any time, and the Lu Memorial Scholarship Foundation reserves the right to remove or discontinue volunteers from program participation at any time, without the necessity of any reason or notice.
