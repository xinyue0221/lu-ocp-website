          </p>
          
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">As a Lu Scholar, you commit to:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-gray-700">
            <li className="mb-2">Maintaining academic honesty in all educational pursuits</li>
            <li className="mb-2">Submitting original work and properly attributing others' ideas and contributions</li>
            <li className="mb-2">Representing your achievements and qualifications accurately and truthfully</li>
            <li className="mb-2">Using scholarship funds responsibly and as intended</li>
            <li className="mb-2">Contributing positively to your academic and broader communities</li>
            <li className="mb-2">Upholding the values of the Lu Memorial Foundation in your academic work and personal conduct</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            We believe that adherence to these principles not only fosters an atmosphere of trust and respect but also honors the legacy of Tingyu Lu, who exemplified these values throughout his life and work. Lu Scholars are expected to demonstrate integrity in all aspects of their academic and professional development, and to contribute to creating a community based on mutual respect, ethical conduct, and a commitment to positive change.
