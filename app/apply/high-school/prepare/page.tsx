      question: 'Do I need to be in the top of my class to apply for the Lu Memorial Scholarship?',
      answer: 'While we value academic excellence, we do not have specific GPA or class rank requirements. We evaluate each application holistically, taking into account the challenges and opportunities available at your school. We recognize that grading scales and academic rigor vary widely across different schools, so we emphasize your overall growth, intellectual curiosity, and commitment to learning rather than focusing solely on grades or class rank.'

      id: '2',
      question: 'How important are advanced courses (AP, IB, Honors) for my application?',
      answer: 'We value students who challenge themselves with rigorous coursework, but we also recognize that access to advanced courses varies widely across schools. We encourage you to take advantage of the most challenging courses available to you, but we evaluate your curriculum in the context of what\'s offered at your school. Quality of engagement is more important than the quantity or label of advanced courses. We\'re looking for evidence that you\'re intellectually curious and willing to challenge yourself, regardless of whether that happens in AP, IB, Honors, or regular courses.'

      id: '3',
      question: 'I\'m interested in a STEM career. Should I focus only on STEM courses?',
      answer: 'While we support students with strong interests in particular fields, the Lu Memorial Scholarship values a well-rounded education. Even students pursuing STEM careers benefit from developing strong communication skills, historical and cultural awareness, and ethical reasoning that come from a broad liberal arts education. We encourage you to pursue your interests deeply while also maintaining breadth across different disciplines. This approach fosters innovative thinking and the ability to make connections across fields, which are key values of the Lu Memorial Scholarship.'

    {
      id: '4',
      question: 'My school doesn\'t offer many advanced courses. Will this hurt my chances?',
      answer: 'No. We evaluate your academic choices in the context of what\'s available at your school. We\'re interested in how you\'ve made the most of your educational opportunities, not in comparing the offerings at different schools. If your school offers limited advanced coursework, consider ways you\'ve supplemented your learning through independent projects, online courses, summer programs, or community college classes. In your application, you can use the Additional Information section to provide context about your school\'s academic offerings and how you\'ve sought out challenges within your environment.'
